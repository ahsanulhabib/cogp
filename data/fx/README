PACIFIC Exchange Rate Service

Data generated from http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/data.html

Input: day (in increasing order)
Output: exchange rate vs USD of top 10 currencies and 3 precious metals

Each year has about 250 day so we can have up to 2500 inputs, 13 outputs.

Setting in Alvarez et al:
- fxdata2007.csv: exchange rates in the year 2007 as retrieved from website
- fx2007-processed.csv: 
cut -d ',' -f 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 fxdata2007.csv > fx2007-processed.csv
Because of missing data, used vim to repalce ,, with ,-1, => output value of -1 is missing data
Then replace , (at the beginning of a line) with -1,

- Outputs are standardized to have zero mean & unit variance
- R_s = 1 (smoothing kernels) and R_o = 3 (whitenoise processes)
- Best SMSE reported 0.2795 for CGP, 0.3927 for MTGP (R=2)

missing data for the CAD, JPY, AUD outputs and make prediction for these
- days 50-100 from CAD
- days 100-150 from JPY
- days 150-200 from AUD
