We perform three sets of experiments to evaluate the model and the stochastic variational inference proposed. 
First, we use a toy problem to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning the model parameters.
Second, we assess the predictive accuracy of the model on two medium-sized datasets and compare with existing multiple output models.
In the final experiments, we evaluate the model on large-scale learning with multiple tasks.

\subsection{TOY PROBLEM}
In this toy problem we use two related outputs generated from the same latent function $sin(x)$ but are corrupted by independent noises: $y_1(x) = sin(x) + \epsilon$ and $y_2(x) = -sin(x) + \epsilon$, $\epsilon \sim \Normal(0,0.01)$.
Each output has missing values in one region of the input space.
% Say that this is from a single gpsvi
The predictive distributions of the model compared to that of independent gps are shown in \ref{fig5}.
